  As a detail-oriented Network Engineer, I bring 2 years of hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining high-performance network infrastructures. I have successfully configured and managed routers, switches, firewalls, and VPNs to ensure seamless connectivity across both LAN and WAN environments. My expertise includes working with Axgate and Cisco devices, with a strong focus on optimizing network performance and security.

    The Flight Schedule project represents a personal endeavor in which I sought to gain deeper knowledge and experience with API request handling. My passion for managing flight schedules, developed through extensive global travel, fueled my interest in leveraging an API from API Hub to enrich my learning experience. To enhance the quality and organization of the project, I utilized styled components, a styling library that provides a more modular, maintainable, and efficient approach to styling React components. Additionally, I implemented TypeScript to improve the overall code quality, maintainability, and scalability of the project. The strong typing system of TypeScript enabled me to better structure the code and provide more comprehensive documentation, while also improving tooling support.

    The To-Do project was developed utilising Vanilla Javascript for the front-end and in order to optimise user experience, the project leverages the Geolocation API, allowing for automatic detection of the user's current location, and the real-time display of weather conditions specific to that location. The primary function of the To-Do project centers on the full CRUD cycle, which enables users to easily create, retrieve, update, and delete their personalised list of tasks which increasing productivity.
